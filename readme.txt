== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I upload an image? =

The Cybook Bookeen Widget does not provide a mechanism for uploading images or files. You can however upload an image in the 'Write' section of WordPress. From there you can click on the 'Add an Image' icon (next to 'Add Media' label). After uploading an image, copy the 'Link URL' for use in your Cybook Bookeen Widget.

= How many images can be display? =

Each instance of the widget can only display one image, but you can create as many instances as you need.

= How do I change the alignment? =

This can be done with CSS.  Depending on your WordPress theme, one of these methods below will work, though you may have to experiment a little to find out which one.

For the last one with margin top, right, bottom, and left, replace the 0's with a number, for example 10px, where the px stands for pixels.  As you increase or decrease a side, the Ereader will shift position enabling you to get the perfect spacing in you sidebar.  Don't forget that you can use negative numbers too, like -10px.  Experiment with the numbers and refresh your website to see what way the Ereader moves in your sidebar.  Keep doing this until its just right!) :

`.cybookbookeen { text-align: center; }
.cybookbookeen { margin:0 auto; }
.cybookbookeen { margin:0 auto; text-align: center; }
.cybookbookeen { margin:0 auto; text-align: left; }
.cybookbookeen { margin-top:0px; margin-right:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; }`
